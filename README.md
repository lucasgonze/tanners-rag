Music notation for Tanner's Rag by the Skillet Lickers. This band existed 1924-1931, so I think this composition is in the public domain.

The straight eighth notes in the first eight bars are approximations of the rhythm as originally played. The way to approach them is to use those exact pitches but come up with a rhythm of your own. 

Transcribed by Lucas Gonze from the original. Any copyright in my work here is hereby dedicated to the public domain using a CC0 1.0 Universal dedication.

I can easily do guitar, banjo or mandolin tab if it's helpful. Just post an issue.
